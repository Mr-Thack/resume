    # Change this section to Additional Skills & Experiences
    # The goal, Mr. Fowler said, is to make me more memorable than my skills
    # Because he said that they'll get many people who are competent, especially from Tech,
    # but I've gotta differentiate myself from them somehow.
    #
    # He said to include:
    # Languages,
    # Skills (one of which he suggested should be listed as Mechanical Arts or some other fancy wording for it),
    # Interests (his example had "App Development, Design, Traveling, Architecture" listed)
    # Well, my interests are Skateboarding and I guess I could say Rubix Cubes
    # He also said that he thought my little sister's jeep story was good.
    # So, he told me that I want them to think about the jeep when I leave and remember me with that.
    # But, I'd want it to be something that they'd like ask me about and then I'd weave in that story.
    # For example, he said, if I had put "tinkering in the garage" or something like that,
    # then they'd naturally ask me what I tinker on, and I could bring up her jeep.
